## Abstract

QuickShift is a brand new, innovative way for restaurants and other businesses to quickly staff their work dynamically based on real time demands.   It allows restaurants to post shifts that workers can claim quickly, reducing staffing gaps that might impact service.   The app will include a shift management system, notifications for workers who are available, and a very flexible way to schedule.   QuickShift will finally address the needs for efficient, adaptable, and reliable staffing that restaurants have been struggling with forever.

## Project Description

	Across the globe, there are many many restaurants, stores, and other establishments that need constant staffing.   Unfortunately, many of these restaurants have dealt with lack of proper staffing, busy seasons, and other issues.   At the moment, these restaurants rely on unreliable methods like calling employees directly, or posting last minute ads which tends to fail to fill the available shifts.   Quickshift provides a much better solution - on demand work.   The application will allow businesses to post shifts in real-time, allowing workers to quickly fill the positions based on the establishments requirements. 

## User Stories
As an employee starting on QuickShift, I want to be able to easily pick up jobs in my location at various places, so I can make some extra money on the side easily.

As an employer starting on QuickShift, I want to be able to quickly fill positions that require little training overhead in order to keep the business running smoothly.

As a returning employee on QuickShift, I want to be able to access better positions and jobs with my rating, in order to make more money than I had before.

As a returning employer on QuickShift, I want to have high-quality workers at any moment of the day in case of cancellations and busy days by paying more, in order to generate more revenue and prohibit slowdowns.

## ABET Concerns Essay

Constraints When designing QuickShift, a lot of constraints arose. The first one is security since the platform handles very sensitive user data such as payment and personal information. There needs to be top tier encryption and authentication. There are also legal constraints such as data privacy like GDPR and CCPA, but also labor laws and how to handle them as independent contractors. There needs to be expert data handling practices and clear user consent protocols which impact how data is stored. There are also economic constraints such as budget limitations that constrict the choice of technologies. This may force us to use open-source frameworks or cloud services. This influences the entire infrastructure and pushes us to use affordable yet reliable cloud providers that ensure scalability. Lastly, there are ethical considerations such as fair labor practices and ensuring no one is exploited. There needs to be algorithms that promote equal shift distribution and prevent bias in worker selection. These constraints ensure that QuickShift is secure, cost-effective, and ethical.

## Self-Assessment Essays

JACOB
Our senior design idea, QuickShift, is aimed towards building an equivalent of gig platforms (Doordash) but for restaurant employees, and where restaurants can assign shifts for workers. From an academic point of view, being a senior computer science major this project would afford the practical application of software development, user interface design and data management skills I've learned thus far in my degree. QuickShift aims to solve a common problem in the restaurant sector: maintenance problems such as staff availability which hampers the normal running of activities. The operation of intelligent matching algorithms and convenient user interface that will be used in our platform will make the process of filling the open shifts fast. In this project we are actually able to blend or combine both the theoretical and practical aspects that we learn in class. It will be inspiring to apply this idea and observe it affect the given field. The college courses which I have taken have gone a long way in preparing me for the development of QuickShift. In the course CS 2028C Data Structures, I came across efficient algorithms that shall be helpful in sorting and pairing of shifts in the platform. CS-3003 Programming Languages exposed me to the entire functionality of software development process giving me the skills to plan, design, implement and test software systems. From CS-5156 Computer Networks (in progress), I understood databases, hence designing and managing the data structures required to store information about the users and shifts. The course CS 5064: Artificial Intelligence made me develop interest in adding intelligence to software, which we will deploy in our project to facilitate appropriate matching of the users. Apart from technical competencies, these courses also introduced me to analytical thinking and decision making which are what will enable us overcome some of the difficulties that may be encountered in the process of development. With the academic experiences I have made, I will be in a position to apply quick shift where I will be of utmost importance. My co-op experiences have also impacted overall strategy for QuickShift project too. During my course, I did three co-op terms at Siemens Digital Industries Software and was employed as Software Engineer Intern and I had practical experience in the development of software. I developed in C++ and Tcl/TK; the projects were to clean up, refactor, and improve the quality of existing code, which I personally will use for QuickShift. Moreover, while on my double rotation, I was privileged to mentor another intern and therefore I strengthened my leadership and communication skills apart from being able to learn the process of working within a team setting. The use of GitLab for version control and project management also helped me improve my organizational skills that will help me intended to coordinate the team’s working process in QuickShift. These five experiences above have taught me both technical and non-technical skills that I will use to help make our project well structured, efficient, and successful. QuickShift is exciting for me to work on as it aims to solve a real-life problem within the food sector especially the restaurants industry, which sometimes experience staff changes at the last minute. The opportunity to work on designing the solution that can has a real impact on business motivates me to the greatest extent of my ability as I have wanted to create a product that will impact restaurants by providing them with flexible staff options and employees would be glad to get job offers from the restaurants applying this solution. This project also resonates with my passion of building technology applications that address real life challenges in people’s lives. It is my hope that I will be able to assist in developing a tool that de-sweats the whole process of staffing and consequently make things easier for restaurants to run. Joining this project means that I can contribute to something that is valuable while continuing working on myself. As far as QuickShift evolution is concerned, our strategy is to create the initial version, which includes significant features, like shift postings and sign-up, and then generate a series of modifications according to the users’ feedback. We want to incorporate the best practices we will identify throughout the development process so that we can enhance the platform as we continue to gain insight into our users’ requirements. The anticipated result is a functional system that matches restaurants with employees on job boards and help relieve the pressure of last minute hiring. To self-assess my contributions, I will review my work with benchmarks that have been set in terms of progress and guarantee that the quality of the work is up to par. The fact that the platform is workable, easy to navigate, effectively obtained positive feedbacks from test users will be an indication that I have done a good job. Success, therefore, will be in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of the platform in terms of usability, reliability, and functionality of the platform to these key stakeholders: the restaurants, and the workers.

	Introduction My senior design project focuses on the development of a new software with a social purpose to solve existing issues. Being a computer science student, I consciously strive to develop the concept for my senior design, which would combine the knowledge and experience I have acquired during my study and bring a positive and worthy change to the people. This project will afford me a chance to practice the theories that I study in class, think critically, and work in a team to develop a more efficient, integrated, and reliable software system. Guidance from College Curriculum While studying at the University of Cincinnati, I have completed several computer science classes, each of which will be critical in determining the elements of my senior design project. Courses like CS2028C: Data Structures and CS4071: Design and Analysis of Algorithms have taught me how to approach program development in the most efficient way, by using the right data structures and designing the right algorithms. Additionally, CS4092: Database Design and Development will guide the design of the backend of the project and optimize the database structure. I've also gained valuable insights into software security through IT2030C: Information Security and Assurance, which will assist me in ensuring that the project adopts best security practices from the developmental stage. These courses have equipped me with the technical and theoretical knowledge to implement a high-quality product. Advices from Co-op and Work Experience Both my co-ops at Siemens as a full-stack engineer have also helped build my capacity to contribute to the senior design project. I had the opportunity to experience both the front end and the back end, working with technologies such as React, C#, and SQL to enhance web applications. I also worked with advanced methodologies and frameworks such as Agile, which help in defining the roles and responsibilities of every team member, communicating with the team members of a software development project, and monitoring the progress of the project from initiation to implementation. Additionally, working at various restaurants over time and driving for Uber and DoorDash, I learned important aspects of customer interaction and quick decision-making in problem-solving. These technical and non-technical skills will assist in my ability to work with my fellow colleagues and contribute to all aspects of the senior design project. Motivation for the Project I have a lot of enthusiasm for participating in the senior design project because it presents opportunities to address real-life challenges and demonstrate my personal growth as a software engineer. Another reason is to find a job in which I can freely utilize my abilities and maybe make a small change that could enhance the functioning of companies or people’s lives. Particularly, I have done work in restaurants and other gig economy jobs, so I am thrilled about designing software that will help these businesses. This passion for software development and the quest to continue improving my understanding of how to develop software drive my interest in taking on increasingly complex projects. Preliminary Project Approach and Evaluation There will be planning and understanding of the requirements that have to be met, as well as designing a good architecture that can be expanded and is secure. To achieve this, I intend to incorporate Agile methodologies to maintain general flexibility and improvement throughout the process. In order to meet the goals of the project, I anticipate delivering a well-organized, easily navigable software solution. Depending on the progress, I will make a self-assessment based on the simplicity of the code, optimized algorithms, and system efficiency. I will know I have done a good job when I complete all the functional requirements of the project, encounter a few bugs in the final product, and receive favorable feedback from my colleagues and instructors. Impact and Future Potential This senior design project has the potential of presenting more than just academic satisfaction. When creating software, I have long-term objectives of delivering a socially responsible product that rejects ineffective solutions for communities and businesses. Perhaps, the researched project might be used as the basis for further advancements in the given field, with the opportunity of expanding the size of the application and bringing it to larger markets and various applications. I believe that the knowledge I am going to use in this project, such as database tuning, security, and Agile development, will help me achieve success in this project as well as in future projects as I progress in my career. Furthermore, it must also be noted that the success of the project may extend further into how technology fosters positive change and may consequently encourage more students as well as professionals to work towards similar objectives.

For my team's senior design project, we are going to be working on a full stack
application called QuickShift. A common challenge affecting restaurants and other
forms of businesses is the inconsistency in the availability of staff where businesses
may be forced to close during times when they would normally be open due to lack of
employees. This mainly inconveniences both the staff and the impatient customers
especially within the region of Cincinnati which has an active dining and shopping
industry. QuickShift is proposed to provide the solution as an on demand staffing service
that allows the hiring organization to engage the independent workers on a short term
basis. QuickShift empowers restaurants, stores, and various other small businesses to
advertise shifts for jobs that do not require any training, including; bussers, hosts,
dishwashers, cashiers, and food runners among others. Through the described
approach, experienced independent workers in these positions can search and choose
the shifts according to availability, location, and competencies to meet the demand; on
the other hand, businesses can quickly fill the vacancies and function efficiently.
Both my college curriculum and my co-op experiences has helped me develop
the skills I need in order to complete this project. Courses like CS4071 Design and
Analysis of Algorithms have sharpened my problem-solving skills and helped me create
efficient algorithms that I can use in making sure that the projects performance is good.
CS3093C: Software Engineering* introduced me to agile development practices,
version control, and code quality assurance, which will help me maintain a streamlined,
collaborative workflow throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, courses such as
4092 Database Design have given me a better understanding of both relational and non relational (NoSQL) databases, giving me a better understanding to be able to effectively
manage backend database operations in a scalable and better way.
My co-op experiences have further honed my technical and non-technical skills,
allowing me to bring real-world knowledge to the project. While working as a Software
Engineer Co-op at Siemens PLM Software, I contributed to a large codebase using
technologies like C++, .NET , and Docker, which helped my ability to work in very large
codebases, and also greatly increased my communication skills as there were many
things in the codebase I didn’t understand or know and had to ask for help. My work at
both Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and Cincinnati Incorporated as a Software
Developer/Engineer Co-op enhanced more of technical skills, where I was mostly
focusing mostly on backend development using .NET , but I also had the opportunity to
work on frontend applications using primarily React .NET MAUI/Blazor.
I am excited about the technical challenges and innovative potential that
QuickShift presents. One of the things motivating me is the opportunity to design a
solution that will have a direct impact on local restaurants and shops in the Cincinnati
area. This project not only leverages my technical expertise in full-stack development,
but it also addresses a real-world problem. My approach to the problem would be designing a scalable and performant application. I believe that I would probably be focusing on the backend of the application as that’s what my experience is mostly focusing on. I’m expecting a fully working app that can at least have shops registered to the app, and can hire people to take on shifts, which would also be the final expected product. I can self evaluate my contributions by
checking out the tasks i’ve done and lines added and deleted.

After a lengthy discussion, the team and I concluded one idea that my team and I desired to work on. Our idea is called QuickShift which is an app that allows businesses to find individuals to cover shifts that don’t require training. The goal of this project is to make a fully functional app that is both easy to use and powerful for businesses and those looking to work quick jobs. While the scope is largely a web application with a backend, I plan on trying it out on other platforms natively and receiving input from businesses. This is significant to me because I always wanted to pursue a career in full stack applications, and I am excited to work on something that is very marketable. I feel that this application can empower employers and employees by offering both workers and customizable schedules. With this project I hope to use the information I learned through our time at the University of Cincinnati.
	 Throughout University, there are many classes I have taken that will help me be a valuable member on this project. I have taken classes like Data Structures (CS 2028C) to better understand how to manage large-scale data and organize it. Classes like Software Engineering (EECE 3093C) allowed me to work with a team and deliver a small-scale app. In this class I got to go through the full software development lifecycle. Lastly, a class I am taking right now is called User Interface (CS 5167). This class will be very helpful when designing an interface for people that are not as technical. This will be a huge help when creating an app for the public. Although classes are a major help when creating this app, my COOP experience will also be valuable.
	For my COOP experiences I worked as a Software Developer at both Siemens and London Computer Systems. At both companies I learned how the content I learn in class is used in the real world. I also learned how to create complex apps and work with others on an already established code base and sometimes I even created a new code base and explained it to others. Other skills I learned are debugging, testing, project structure, project management, and implementing large changes. During this project I plan on using the knowledge I learned to deliver a robust project. COOP has taught me how to make software that is production ready and satisfies the needs of the public.
	This project is something I am very excited and motivated about. Firstly, I get to work with modern web technologies which is something I really wanted more experience in as it is used everywhere. I also aspire to be a business owner someday and creating something that will help small businesses fix staffing issues is something I can see leaving a big impact. I plan on designing the app first in Figma and getting lots of input from my team and then some small business owners, then I plan on starting with the code. With this I plan on getting approvals from small businesses and people that would like to work quick jobs. Success for this project will be determined by the satisfaction data I collect on our small-scale demos and from the knowledge my team and I gain. In terms of my contribution, I will be measuring it by how the app looks and feels since my focus will be frontend.
	This project will be something that brings together everything I have learned throughout my academic career from both my COOP and my classes. Creating this project won’t only be necessary from an assignment perspective about also as proof to myself that I have truly gained from my university experience. This project will be something I can show to employers and discuss interviews. I can even use this project as educational experience to create more complex future works. I am looking forward to creating a fully functional application with a team of individuals who are both passionate and talented. I hope to deliver a strong and robust project and learn along the way

Senior Design Project Overview
QuickShift, my senior design project, goes even further by solving the understaffing issue with
the development of an operational on-demand staffing platform for small companies, namely
restaurants in Cincinnati. From an academic point of view, the project is about creating an
application that will perform an instant matching for employers and dependent contractors for
short-term employment opportunities. All these elements will include job advertisement and
hiring, job reservation with payments, as well as the functional design of the user and employer
facets of the system. In this project, concepts learned in class, particularly the computer science
course will be useful in application of design theories, research methods, software development
processes and security planning. The aim for this project in future is to create functional,
affordable and safe mobile and web application which restraint both businesses and freelance
workers be it in the gig economy or the traditional market.
College Curriculum Influence
The knowledge acquired in the college courses taken at the University of Cincinnati is
indispensable in the evolution of Quickshift. For instance, in EECE3093C Software Engineering,
I understood concepts such as the software development lifecycle, version control systems and
the different types of development approaches like the Agile approach, all of which are useful in
the well structured growth of the project. The course also highlighted the processes of collecting
client specifications, verifying the end product and adjusting it, which are all important for the
creation of a viable and usable service such as QuickShift. Further, in CS 4071 Design and
Analysis of Algorithms, I acquired more knowledge on designing efficient algorithms for
applications used in real time. I saw how one can evaluate the time complexity and space
complexity of algorithms which will help in improving the efficiency of the job matching
process on Quickshift. These courses have instilled both technical skills like coding and
debugging and soft skills like problem solving and teamwork which are very important as I
embark on this project.
Co-op Experiences Influence
The co-op terms completed by me as a Full Stack Developer at ITI and as a Cybersecurity
Consultant at CDW have made me rethink my way of going about this project. At ITI, I had the
opportunity to learn practically both front-end and back-end development in the form of
JavaScript, Python, and SQL databases. This role involved how to create applications that could
accommodates a growing user base and improved my knowledge of user interface concepts,
which will be very important when creating the easy to use QuickShift interface. While at CDW,
my role was that of a Cybersecurity Consultant and my emphasis was on implementing security
measures in computer systems used by clients. This career path gave me a deep understanding of
data security, information encryption and secure e-commerce solutions – all of them essential for
storing and protecting sensitive details of users in the QuickShift platform. These co-ops have
not only polished my technical competence but also showed me first hand the value of
collaboration, dealing with clients and managing projects. I expect to use these skills inasmuch
as technically, the QuickShift project should be of high quality and likewise, meet its end users’
expectations.
Motivation and Project Approach
I am particularly keen to engage myself in the project, QuickShift, since it is a practical solution
for an issue that local businesses and gig workers are suffering. To build a platform that can be
used to hire people on a flexible basis to assist small businesses perform the same more
effectively is very compelling for me. I see the project development as sequential rather than
continuous whereby my initial intention is to spend a significant amount of time on modularizing
the problem: authentication, job posting, job matching, and making payments. I would like to
follow the Agile approach, where I intend to be building each module then testing it in order to
assess the usability as well as safety of the system. One of the main activities in my dissertation
will be the development of a deep learning algorithm focused on the job-matching process which
will solve this connector issue at a deeper level.
Expected Outcomes and Self-Evaluation
As far this project is concerned, by the end of it, I hope to have created an app which allows
small business to provide real time staffing solutions. The effectiveness of this goal will most
probably evaluated through the ease of use, security and the scalability of the system. I will also
review my input through raising careful issues with respect to the platform operation and its
enhancement through the target benchmarks of performance and user tests. Moreover, I will
appraise myself in the basis that the platform observes the minimum requirements for the
effective security of information systems such as the protection of sensitive information and
secure transactions. My efforts towards making the application relevant and functional will be
deemed a success when the application is able to store and process information in real time, does
not compromise on the ease of use and security functionality, and does not hang or freeze up for
an extensive period of time. This will be a demonstration that the theoretical knowledge and
practical skills gained through the four years of college education has been put into practic
