# QuickShift Project-Specific Tasks

1. **Design** the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for both the web and mobile applications to ensure intuitive navigation for employers and workers. (Prabhjot)

2. **Develop** the frontend of the web application using React.js to create a responsive and dynamic user interface. (Prabhjot)

3. **Build** the mobile application for iOS and Android platforms using Flutter to provide cross-platform compatibility and a seamless user experience.

4. **Implement** the backend architecture using Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and manage server-side operations efficiently. (Jacob, Prabhjot)

5. **Set up** a scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS or Microsoft Azure (to be discussed) to support real-time data processing and ensure high availability of the QuickShift platform. (Russell)

6. **Integrate** secure payment gateways such as Stripe or PayPal (simulate for now) to facilitate instant and reliable financial transactions between businesses and freelancers. (Russell)

7. **Create** a robust matching algorithm using Python and machine learning techniques to efficiently connect businesses with available workers based on location, availability, and required competencies. (Jacob, Prabhjot)

8. **Develop** RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend systems, ensuring smooth data flow and functionality.

9. **Implement** user authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth 2.0 and JWT to ensure secure access for all users. (Russell)

10. **Design** and **deploy** a relational database schema using PostgreSQL to manage user data, shift postings, and transaction records effectively.

11. **Develop** real-time notification systems using WebSockets to inform users about shift availability and application statuses instantly. (Prabhjot)

12. **Implement** data encryption and security protocols to safeguard personal and financial information of all users, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.

13. **Set up** continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes. (Russell)

14. **Conduct** comprehensive unit and integration testing using Jest and Mocha to identify and fix bugs, ensuring a smooth user experience upon full deployment.

15. **Optimize** the matching algorithm by incorporating machine learning models to enhance accuracy and speed in connecting employers with suitable workers. (Jacob)

16. **Develop** a feedback system that allows users to rate and review shifts and employers, using technologies like React and Node.js to integrate it seamlessly into the platform.

17. **Implement** analytics dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI to monitor platform performance metrics and user engagement.

18. **Create** automated scripts for data backup and recovery to ensure data integrity and availability in case of system failures.

19. **Integrate** third-party services such as Google Maps API to provide location-based shift listings and improve the matching process.

20. **Develop** a comprehensive testing framework to perform load testing and ensure the platform can handle high traffic during peak periods. (Jacob)

21. **Set up** version control using Git and GitHub to manage codebase efficiently and facilitate collaboration among development team members.  (Prabhjot)

22. **Conduct** code reviews and implement best practices for code quality and maintainability, ensuring a robust and scalable codebase.

23. **Implement** push notification services using Firebase to keep users informed about shift updates and important platform announcements. (Russell)

24. **Develop** data analytics modules to track user behavior and platform usage, enabling data-driven decision-making for future enhancements.

25. **Ensure** compliance with labor laws and regulations by implementing necessary features in the platform that handle worker classifications and payment processing accurately.
